% The PhD has been the most incredible, and hardest thing that I have ever done. These are the people who made it possible, and made it a magical four years.

% First and foremost, I'd like to thank Prof. Neil D. Lawrence, my supervisor, for giving me an opportunity to pursue this endeavour, and taking a chance on me. I've also really appreciated your insights into early methods in the field, and your lectures are what made them all click.

% Similarly, I've really enjoyed lectures and other informal talks by Diana Cai, Rich Turner, Carl Rasmussen, David Spiegelhalter, Mark Girolami, James Hensman, ST John, Mark van der Wilk and Emti Khan. Kevin Murphy's book on probabilistic machine learning has been a great resource for a probabilistic summary on many methods that exist. I'd also like to thank Kevin Murphy for pointing me towards the white-box transformer that laid the foundation for the last part of the PhD. It was a conversation with Timothy Johnson (and an exercise by Jacob Barandes) that introduced me to the philosophy of probability, which has been a most enlightening journey. Ferenc, Carl Henrik and Challenger, I'm grateful for your insightful and deeply fun conversations, and your advice over these years. I'm also grateful for my statistics teachers over the years, particularly Fraser Daly, George Streftaris, Sergey Foss and Alexander McNeil.

% I'd like to thank the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery and Schmidt Futures for funding my PhD and providing access to compute, without which this would not have been possible.

% Dirk and Indranil, I've learned so much from you and I'm the person who I am now because of all our discussions and time we spent working on interesting things. I'm deeply grateful for all your advice over these years and your friendship. Thao, likewise, we're very similar in many ways and I'm glad for our friendship over the pandemic and before it, you helped me get through a lot of that time, and I miss our long walks around London.

% I'd like to thank Pietro Lio for the advice over these years, and for making it possible for me to work on one of the coolest problems I've worked on through an internship at Valence. I'd also like to thank Jason for his support at Valence, and to everyone who made the place so welcoming, particularly Cian and Austin. Miruna, I had already really loved our conversations prior to our internship and I'm glad for your friendship during it.

% Prof. Yamagishi and Erica, thank you for a chance to work on such a cool project, for the freedom you afforded and for making it possible for me to live in Tokyo and visit Seoul. I learnt a lot in that short span of time.

% Ieva and Markus, thank you for the fun and supportive conversations and for the opportunity to work on a climate science project with you. Vincent, Alex, and Slava thank you for the pleasant conversations and the opportunity to work on GeometricKernels. Vidhi, thank you for looping me into your GPLVM projects, without which, this PhD would not have been possible. Emma, I've admired the depth and breadth of your knowledge, and I've loved working with you. Sarah, I you being such an attentive, capable, energetic and proactive student.

% A special thank you to Prof. Hasok Chang for the course \textit{What Is Science} and \textit{Realism}, and the department of the history and philosophy of science for other courses such as \textit{Theory, Evidence and Experimentation}. These have been a truly amazing introduction to the field I've had the privilege of attending.

% To \textit{\textbf{everyone}} who calls me a friend, thank you for being there, for the adventures, for the laughs, for introducing me to people in your life, but most of all, for putting up with me and the way that I am. The PhD is such a wild and relentless journey, and I'm glad that I found so many of you dealing with the same things as I. Everyone here has made an impact on me that I hope never to forget, and I cannot express how much each of you means to me and my journey, and I sincerely love that you've been a part of my life.

% Eric, Jen, Freya and Ray, and Amy, you are my family, and the times I spent with you all have been my fondest memories over these years. I want to thank you all for the adventures, for always being there for me, lending an ear to my pains, for introducing me to your worlds, and helping me understand myself. Eric, your personality is magnetic and I'm so grateful to you for including me in your hobbies, which I so dearly love too, and for inviting me into what became our family. Thank you for being there for me so many times, and for making me laugh and have as much fun as I have with you. Jen, you are one of the few people I feel like I can talk with forever, and you've also supported me so much, unconditionally, throughout these years, in so many ways. I love your friends and all the fun we've had, especially with Sheila. Freya, I'm grateful for your affection and for introducing me to your special interests, the times I spent with you, Jen and Eric were the best parts of these last few years. Ray, you were kind to me during times when no one else was and I cherish our shared adventures. Netta, you're one of the most empathetic and kindest people I've met, and I've loved living with you. Amy, through our infinite shared special interests and troubles and ways of being, you've been one of my closest people, you've made me laugh so much, and I'm grateful for all the time we've shared. I've so dearly loved the times I've spent watching TV, playing D\&D, cooking, gossiping, crafting, board gaming, walking, road-tripping and going to the movies with you all.

% Mala, thank you for being someone who understood some of my aspects at a time when I felt like I couldn't turn to anyone. I'm forever grateful to have had someone to talk to, with whom I feel like I've had so much in common, in terms of the way we think, the way that we are, people we've known and the kind of experiences that we've shared in Cambridge and beyond. I also want to thank you for your patience with me. You're awesome, I find your interests endlessly fascinating, and I've admired your clarity of thought and your resilience. I will really miss the times we've sat by the river at Darwin, or wandered through the city, talking.

% Marie and Nikou, thank you for taking me along with you on your road trips. Those days, and the may balls, our museum wanders, and our first meeting at Shepreth have been some of the happiest memories of my PhD (like singing along to country music on our way back from the beach!). You've made me laugh so much, and made me feel so at home with you, I found a sense of comfort and warmth which I'm so grateful to have received. I dearly love your personalities and I'm so glad to have found friends like you.

% Francisco and Paul, I've learned so much from our endless conversations and have had so much fun being around you. You've made made me laugh so much, and I loved all those late nights we spent talking, joking, gaming, foodie-ing and gossiping. I found a lot of solidarity with you guys, on so many things, and I'm glad to have found friends who are so like-minded.

% Justin, you made the lab a lot less lonely than it would have been, and I've enjoyed our cycling trips. Diana, thank you for also being there and listening in, and for your advice all through these years, the times we spent talking got me through some bad times.

% Nora and Laura, I'm so glad to have found you and our queer neurospicy group, after my house, I'm glad to have found another group of people who I can feel so comfortable to be around, and to be myself. Hyon, thanks for also making me feel so comfortable around you and for making me laugh so much.

% Jana, Rachel, we've shared so many laughs over these years, through games and the outdoors, you've made my time in Cambridge so much more social and fun.

% Raminta, and Scott, you made my Japan experience magical and a lot less lonely than it would have been otherwise. I have a lot of nostalgia for this time.

% I'd like to thank everyone I met at Wolfson for so many random pleasant interactions and conversations (especially my craft club and alt-bop fam), everyone who made my costume designing time at the ADC so incredible (shout out to Jessi for teaching me how to use the sewing machine and for being so fun!), the people who made my novice rowing term special (shout out to Lily, my cox and blockmate, I've loved our conversations, and your older-wiser-sibling energy), the capable people I met at the Northumberland telescopes on many a clear night, and of course, my lab-mates who accompanied me on this journey. My D\&D crews, thank you for providing a weekly dose of fun chaos. Erin, we're spiritual twins and you've been a big part of my life.

% I'd also like to thank everyone who proofread my thesis. From my lab, huge thanks to Neil, Francisco, Diana, Szilvia, and Andrei for their feedback on the manuscript. I'd also like to thank Dirk and Wolfson's writing volunteers, Min and Ditta for helping as much as they did.

% The thesis would not have been possible without my chirpy, cuddly, lovely old sweetie cat, Ivy, who kept me company during many late nights with the thesis. Finally, I'd like to thank my mom for her positivity and for believing in me.
